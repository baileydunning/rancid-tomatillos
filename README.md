## Abstract
In this parody of a familiar vegetable-themed movie rating site, Rancid Tomatillos is an app for viewing the average ratings of a variety of films, and also looking more deeply at each film's details.  Users can search through the films in the database by title or by a selected range of average rating.  Based on these search parameters the user will see an assortment of movie poster thumbnails on the homepage.  By clicking a thumbnail the user navigates to the individual film page to see more details and a carousel of related youtube videos.
